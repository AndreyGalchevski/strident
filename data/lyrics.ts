    text: "Personal choice,personal fear \nMetal noise, war is near \nAbsolute dependence \nFrom society and belief system \nObedient and mind-less\nNice material for priest scheme \n\nNo faith, no war \nNo faith, no war \nGo and fuck you with your fucking faith! \nWhen you obey, you will become a slave!\n\nCritical hit, you piece of meat \nIt seems you agree with Pope's vile greed \nEven after death \nPay for the place \nTo bury corpse and soul \nCatch your fucking \"bless\" \nAsshole!\n\nNo faith, no war \nNo faith, no war \nDon't be a brick without any name! \nReligious reign stands on dead bones and flame!\n\nRun and elude from dark holy gates! \nStill not to late, change doings that are made \nAnarchy and chaos are the tools to do it right! \nShow to brainless sheep, your way through night!\n\nNo faith, no war \nNo faith, no war\nGo and fuck you with your fucking faith!\nWhen you'll prey, you will become a slave!\nDon't be a brick without any name!\nReligious throne made of dead bones and flame!",
